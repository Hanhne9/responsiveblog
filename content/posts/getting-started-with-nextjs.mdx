# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements that make building React applications even more powerful and efficient. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key features and learn how to build a modern web application.

## What's New in Next.js 15

Next.js 15 introduces several groundbreaking features:

- **Improved App Router** with better performance
- **Enhanced Server Components** for better SEO
- **Turbopack** for faster development builds
- **Improved TypeScript support**

> **Note:** Next.js 15 is a major release that focuses on performance, developer experience, and stability.

## Setting Up Your First Project

Let's start by creating a new Next.js project:

\`\`\`bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
\`\`\`

This will create a new Next.js application with all the latest features enabled by default.

## App Router vs Pages Router

The App Router is the recommended approach for new applications. Here's why:

1. **Better Performance** - Server Components by default
2. **Improved SEO** - Better server-side rendering
3. **Enhanced Developer Experience** - Simplified routing

### File Structure

With the App Router, your file structure looks like this:

\`\`\`
app/
  layout.tsx
  page.tsx
  about/
    page.tsx
  blog/
    [slug]/
      page.tsx
\`\`\`

## Server Components

Server Components are one of the most exciting features in Next.js 15. They allow you to render components on the server, reducing the JavaScript bundle size and improving performance.

> **Success:** Server Components are rendered on the server and don't require JavaScript on the client side.

Here's an example of a Server Component:

\`\`\`tsx
// This is a Server Component by default
export default async function BlogPost(props) {
  const params = props.params
  const post = await fetchPost(params.slug)
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </article>
  )
}
\`\`\`

## Data Fetching

Next.js 15 simplifies data fetching with the new `fetch` API and caching mechanisms:

\`\`\`tsx
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
    cache: 'force-cache' // This will cache the data
  })
  
  if (!res.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch data')
  }
  
  return res.json()
}
\`\`\`

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

Next.js 15 works seamlessly with Tailwind CSS. Here's how to set it up:

1. Install Tailwind CSS:
\`\`\`bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
\`\`\`

2. Configure your tailwind.config.js:
\`\`\`js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices when working with Next.js 15:

- **Use Server Components by default** - Only use Client Components when necessary
- **Optimize images** - Use the next/image component for automatic optimization
- **Implement proper error handling** - Use error boundaries and error pages
- **Follow the principle of least privilege** - Only load what you need

> **Warning:** Remember to always validate and sanitize user input, especially when dealing with dynamic routes.

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 represents a significant step forward in React development. With its improved App Router, Server Components, and enhanced performance, it's the perfect choice for building modern web applications.

The combination of these features makes Next.js 15 an excellent choice for:
- E-commerce websites
- Blogs and content sites
- Dashboard applications
- Marketing websites
